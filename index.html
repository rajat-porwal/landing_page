                    <h1>Crafted in Japan. The Mazda Way</h1>
                    <p>Craftsmanship in Japan means more than the ability to make something. It stands for the pursuit of perfection – not in machine-like sense, but with the human touch at its centre. When master craftsmen, called “Takumi” in Japan, dedicate their lives to the creation of an object, they put a piece of their soul into it and thus bring it to life. In Japan, this approach is known as “Monotsukuri”. And this has been the guiding principle for Mazda from the beginning: Our Takumi do not make cars, they craft them.</p>

            <h1>DETAILS MAKE PERFECTION</h1>
            <h4>WHAT DOES PERFECTION WITH A HUMAN TOUCH LOOK LIKE?</h4>
            <p>At Mazda, perfection has a human touch. Our Takumi craftsmen create and hone objects by hand until every detail is just right. To bring this idea of mastery to life, we got up close – really close. From clay models to paint jobs, a collaboration with Macrofying zooms in on the little things that make our cars so special. Discover Mazda as you have never seen it before: under a microscope.</p>

                <h5>THE NEXT LEVEL OF ART IN MOTION</h5>
                <p>The exhilarating performance of the Mazda MX-5 has captivated countless hearts. Its undeniable appeal can be equally attributed to the iconic look with striking colours, such as the new Zircon Sand or the famed Soul Red Crystal. With beautiful proportions, flowing lines and dramatic contours, it enchants your senses before you even step inside.</p>

                <h5>100 Years of MAZDA</h5>
                <p>The joy of driving, lightweight design and the rotary engine: three elements that define Mazda’s DNA – and continue to fascinate the team at the Hiroshima-based carmaker. One Mazda stands out from all the rest for giving all these elements a new level of meaning, cementing the compact rotary-engined sports car in the minds of driving enthusiasts in the UK and around the world.</p>

                <h5>THE DYNAMIC BOND OF JINBA ITTAI</h5>
                <p>Reinterpreted by Mazda, the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai” refers to the bond between car and driver. The driver centric design and responsive handling of the Mazda MX-5 makes you feel like the car is an extension of your body.</p>
